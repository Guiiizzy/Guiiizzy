# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

Hi, I'm Guilherme! Iâ€™m a front-end developer just starting my career in development. I began exploring programming about 3 years ago, and during this time, I've developed a passion for building user-friendly interfaces and learning new web technologies. Although I don't have any professional experience yet, Iâ€™m actively looking for opportunities to enhance my skills and land my first job in the field.

Iâ€™m eager to learn, grow, and contribute to exciting projects. Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me if you have any suggestions, opportunities, or feedback. Letâ€™s build something great together!.

# ðŸ‘¾ Expertise
Iâ€™m a front-end developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™m also expanding my skills into back-end and data technologies. I have experience with Python for automation and data processing, and Iâ€™m familiar with SQL and NoSQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

In addition, I work with Power BI for data visualization and have hands-on experience with cloud platforms like Azure and big data tools like Databricks. Iâ€™m passionate about creating responsive web applications and leveraging data to provide actionable insights.

Iâ€™m constantly learning and looking for opportunities to grow my skills.
